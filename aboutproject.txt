AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM
   using DBMS And JSP.
        My project intends to check all the available airline databases and return a string of results, which can help them in their travel plans. The objectives of this project is to create an airline reservation system where a traveler can request all flight information as per their journey dates. They can get information regarding time, cost, etc all at the same time and place. When the customer calls the counter assistant for his/her travel needs, the counter assistant will enter the customer’s details in the system, the system displays all the available airlines, scheduling and prices. This system would help the airline to better serve its customers by catering to their needs. The site would use a Database to hold this information as well as the latest pricing and availability information for the airlines.
